        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Plain Rice is a simple yet essential dish enjoyed in cuisines around
            the world. Light, fluffy, and mildly fragrant,<br> it serves as the
            perfect base for countless meals, from rich stews and curries to
            stir-fries and grilled dishes. Its neutral flavor allows it to
            complement both savory and spicy foods, making it<br> a versatile staple
            in the kitchen. With just rice, water, and a pinch of salt, you can
            prepare a satisfying and wholesome side dish that never goes out of
            style.

            Cooked to perfection, plain rice has a tender but slightly firm
            texture, with each grain separate rather than sticky. <br>The secret
            lies in rinsing the rice before cooking to remove excess starch and
            allowing it to rest after boiling so it steams to finish cooking
            evenly. <br>Whether served fresh from the pot or reheated the next day,
            plain rice remains a comforting and dependable part of any meal.
