        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Lasagna is a baked Italian-American dish made of layered flat, wide
            pasta, usually rectangular or ribbon-shaped, <br />with various
            fillings like meat sauce, cheese, and vegetables.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's essentially a casserole, where layers of pasta are alternated
            with flavorful components, <br />then baked until bubbly and golden.
            The dish often includes ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan cheeses,
            along with tomato-based or béchamel sauces.

                Cook the Meat Sauce Brown your ground beef or sausage in a
                skillet. Drain excess fat, add tomato sauce, parsley, basil,
                oregano, salt, and pepper. Let simmer for 10–15 minutes.

                Cook the Noodles Boil lasagna noodles in salted water until just
                tender. Drain and lay flat on a towel so they don’t stick.
