        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This simple chocolate cake is a rich, moist, and fluffy treat that’s
            perfect for any occasion. It’s made with cocoa powder for a deep
            chocolate flavor, balanced with just the right amount of sweetness.
            Whether you enjoy it plain, dusted with powdered sugar, or topped
            with creamy frosting, it’s a crowd-pleaser that works just as well
            for birthdays as it does for an everyday dessert. The batter comes
            together quickly, making it a great recipe even for beginner bakers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Baked until tender and airy, this cake has a melt-in-your-mouth
            texture that pairs beautifully with chocolate, vanilla, or even
            coffee-flavored frosting. The addition of boiling water in the
            batter ensures a smooth, silky consistency, giving the cake its
            signature moist crumb. Serve it with a scoop of ice cream for an
            indulgent treat, or enjoy it with a hot cup of coffee or tea for a
            comforting snack.
